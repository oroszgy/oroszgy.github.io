## HuSpaCy

[HuSpaCy](https://github.com/huspacy/huspacy) is a hobby project of mine: it contains Hungarian models for [spaCy](https://spacy.io) and integrates well with Hungarian NLP resources. The project got academic support in 2021, and it has grown to be a fully pledged industrial-strength NLP pipeline which is now widely used in both commercial and academic applications.

[Awesome Hungarian NLP](https://github.com/oroszgy/awesome-hungarian-nlp) is an up-to-date and ever growing collection of NLP resources available for Hungarian.

Occasionally, I contribute to (mostly NLP related) open-source projects. I've made some improvements on [spaCy](https://github.com/explosion/spaCy), [AllenNLP](https://github.com/allenai/allennlp) and [textacy](https://github.com/chartbeat-labs/textacy) amongst others. For a complete list, please check [my Github profile](https://github.com/oroszgy)

## PhD thesis

During my PhD studies, I've done extensive research in morphosyntactic processing of agglutinative languages and developed state-of-the-art NLP methods for Hungarian. [[Read more >>]](/phd)

## Publications

I've published several papers in scientific journals and conferences. For the complete list of publications check [Google Scholar](http://scholar.google.hu/citations?user=aHDWeEMAAAAJ&hl=en) or [MTMT](https://vm.mtmt.hu//search/slist.php?lang=0&AuthorID=10029812).

## Erlide

As part of a research program with the University of Kent, I've enhanced [Erlide](https://github.com/erlang/erlide_eclipse) with refactoring capabilities by integrating it with the [Wrangler](https://refactoringtools.github.io/docs/wrangler/) tool.
