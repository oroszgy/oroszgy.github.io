[HuSpaCy](https://github.com/huspacy/huspacy) is a hobby project of mine aiming at developing and maintaining Hungarian models for [spaCy](https://spacy.io). The project got academic support in 2021, and it has grown to be a fully pledged industrial-strength NLP pipeline which is now widely used in both commercial and academic applications.
