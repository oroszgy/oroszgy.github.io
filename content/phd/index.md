As part of my research, I've developed a state-of-the-art open-source morphological disambiguator tool called [PurePos](https://github.com/ppke-nlpg/purepos). This tool is now part of the most commonly used Hungarian natural language pipelines such as *magyarlanc* and [`emtsv`](https://github.com/nytud/emtsv).
